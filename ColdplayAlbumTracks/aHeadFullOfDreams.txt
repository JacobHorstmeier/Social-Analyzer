oh I think I landed
in a world I hadn’t seen
when I’m feeling ordinary
when I don’t know what I mean

oh I think I landed
where there are miracles at work
for the thirst and for the hunger
come the conference of birds

saying it’s true, it’s not what it seems
leave your broken windows open
and in the light just streams
and you get a head, a head full of dreams
you can see the change you wanted
be what you want to be
and you get a head, a head full of dreams
into life I’ve just been spoken
with a head full, a head full of dreams

oh I think I landed
where there are miracles at work
when you got me open-handed
when you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams
