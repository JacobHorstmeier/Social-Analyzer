Been around the world
The wonders to view
Been around the world
Looking for someone like you
Pyramids try
Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die
Aim never untrue
I’m never so high as when I’m with you
And there isn’t a fire that I wouldn’t walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world
The universe too
I’ve been around flying, baby
It’s nothing I wouldn’t do
Tanzaku stars
Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

Cause I never say die
Aim never untrue
Never so high as when I’m with you
And there isn’t a fire
That I wouldn’t walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It’s my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
