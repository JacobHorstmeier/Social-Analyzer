oh angel sent from up above
you know you make my world light up
when I was down, when I was hurt
you came to lift me up

life is a drink and love’s a drug
oh now I think I must be miles up
when I was a river dried up
you came to rain a flood

you said ‘drink from me, drink from me’
when I was so thirsty
poured on a symphony
now I just can’t get enough
put your wings on me, on me
when I was so heavy
poured on a symphony
when I’m low low low low

I oh I oh I
got me feeling drunk and high
so high so high
oh I oh I oh I
now I’m feeling drunk and high
so high so high

oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
life is a drink and your love’s about
to make the stars come out

put your wings on me, on me
when I was so heavy
poured on a symphony
when I’m low low low low

I oh I oh I
you got me feeling drunk and high
so high so high
oh I oh I oh I
now I’m feeling drunk and high
so high so high

I oh I oh I
la la la la la la la
so high so high

oh I oh I oh I
now I’m feeling drunk and high
so high so high
that I shoot across the sky
that I shoot across the
that I shoot across the sky
watch me shoot across the
